# TECHNICAL TEST

### HOW TO RUN THE TESTS 
In order to run the tests, Google Chrome and Gradle need to be installed. 

Then, either import the project into an IDE and run the tests using testng or `cd` onto the folder and run:

`gradle test`

The report for the results of the tests can be seen at 

`/build/reports/tests/packages/tests.html`


### REQUESTED TESTS

As​ ​a​ ​client​ ​I​ ​would​ ​like​ ​to​ ​add​ ​two​ ​products​ ​to​ ​the​ ​shopping​ ​basket.

You can use any online shopping web page (for example zalando.es).

Tests should be written in Java (or any JVM language) and easily runnable from command
line (preferably gradle).
 
 You can use any framework.
  
  The goal is to show all the best
practices you know in test automation.


Code should be stored in repository (public one or you can send a zipped version to us). 

If
you think it might be helpful for the reviewer, please attach some readme.
